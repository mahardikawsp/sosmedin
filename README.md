# Design Document: Sosmedin

## Overview

Sosmedin is a modern social media platform inspired by Threads, focusing on text-based content and threaded conversations. The platform will provide a clean, minimalistic interface with both light and dark themes, optimized for all devices. This document outlines the technical design and architecture decisions for implementing the platform based on the requirements.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

Sosmedin will be built using a modern web application stack with the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js React application with TypeScript
   - Server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load performance
   - Client-side navigation for smooth transitions between pages
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

2. **Backend**: Next.js API routes (serverless functions)
   - RESTful API endpoints for data operations
   - Authentication and authorization middleware

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
   - Relational database for structured social data
   - Efficient querying for complex social relationships

4. **Storage**: Cloud storage (using bucket storage from claw cloud)
   - For user-uploaded content like profile pictures

5. **Caching Layer**: Redis
   - For session management and frequently accessed data
   - Improves response times for common queries
